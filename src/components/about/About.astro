    I'm a front-end engineer who's passionate about clean code and simple,
    effective interfaces. I get genuinely excited about challenging,
    high-traffic projectsâ€”and I enjoy diving into them headfirst. I'm easy to
    work with, blend well into any team, and I work remotely, which helps keep
    things cost-efficient. If you've got something tricky on your hands, you're
    in good company.
